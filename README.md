# About Me
I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Statistcs and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes **Graph neural network**,**Large language model**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jing](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=jingby&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) from [School of Statistcs and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), Southern University of Science and Technology. I was advised by [Prof. Yang](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~yangp/) of Financial Simulation Intelligence Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/), Southern University of Science and Technology.
